# freeR

*  A Shiny App that provides links to Free R Resources.
*  Currently contains a list of R books freely available online.
*  Primarily for my own reference, as the list expands it will be easier to search the table for required resource, and it reduces multiple bookmarks to [just one](https://committedtotape.shinyapps.io/freeR/)!
